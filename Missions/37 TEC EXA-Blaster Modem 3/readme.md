# 37 TEC EXA-Blaster Modem 3

In this mission, the hacker needs to simultaneously trigger the same message on a number of pagers. Only one pager can be reached via dial up model at a time and the message upload and page trigger can be processed separately.

In this solution, each pager is given the message in turn.  In a second wave of connections, a trigger EXA is deployed with a centrally tracked countdown which allows all EXAs to fire at the same time without a connection.
