# 42 U.S. Department of Defence

This is the forth of the bonus missions that open up at the end of the main storyline.  The goal of this mission is to brute force your way into the Department of Defence's network and to copy a top secret file to the host device.  Unlike other missions, the network will only allow one active Exa unit to function at a time and data cannot be sent across the network using the global register.

[XA](01-XA.exa) is self replicating exa with branching functionality.
