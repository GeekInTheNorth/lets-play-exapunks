# 25 Deadlock's Domain

The hacker enters a third battle, this time with deadlock.  The aim of the battle is to be the hacker whose EXA units return the most files to their host. Points are scored for every file taken and points are lost for every kill command.

Solution 1 is an aggressive approach, XB moves first to kill the oppositions EXA while XA delays for three cycles, clones itself and randomly selects a target system to steal a file from.

| Solution | Score | Cycles | Size | Activity | EXA Modules|
|:---------|------:|-------:|-----:|---------:|------------|
| 01       |     6 |    100 |   27 |        - | [XA](01-XA.exa) [XB](01-XB.exa) |
