# 30 The Wormhole

The hacker enters a forth battle, this time with X10X10X.  The aim of the battle is to be the hacker who owns the most EXA units inside the network.  Each recurrence of the battle has a different layout with random link addresses which are prime numbers between 2 and 13. Points are scored for each exa in existance, points are lost for executing the kill command.

The path to success in this mission is battle, trying to be too smart consumes cycles and ultimately slows down the spread of EXA units.

| Solution | Score | Cycles | Size | Activity | EXA Modules|
