# 03 Trash World News Tutorial 3

In this mission, the hacker has to access a file containing 2 values and copy them in the reverse order to a new file in the outbox before destroying the original.

With the REPL command it's possible to do this with one EXA module with an increase in size by 1 and a reduction in activity by 1. But the point is to learn how to use multiple EXA units.

| Solution | Cycles | Size | Activity | EXA Modules|
|:---------|-------:|-----:|---------:|------------|
| 01       |     10 |   14 |        4 | [XA](01-XA.exa) [XB](01-XB.exa) |
| 02       |      9 |   13 |        4 | [XA](02-XA.exa) [XB](02-XB.exa) [XC](02-XC.exa) |
