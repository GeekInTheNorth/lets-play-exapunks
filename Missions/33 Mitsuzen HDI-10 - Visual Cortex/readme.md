# 33 Mitsuzen HDI-10 - Visual Cortex

The main character has the Phage which is causing their body to degrade. In this mission, you are using the EXA bots to maintain the nerv connection between your visual cortex and the optic nervs. The EXA bots will check 9 optic nervs, count the number raising a signal above -55 and send 5 times that number less 75 to the visual cortex.

Solution 02 improves on solution 01 by using replication to occupy all optic nerves and perform the calculations at the optic nerve so that the exa at the visual cortex just has to sum and submit the value.
