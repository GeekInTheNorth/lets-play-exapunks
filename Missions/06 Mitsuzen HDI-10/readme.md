The main character has the Phage which is causing their body to degrade. In this mission, you are using the EXA bots to maintain the nerv connection between your central nervous system and your left arm. The Exa bots must efficiently transfer signals from the former to the later while compensating for the failing nervous system sending signals outside of the -120 to 50 range.
