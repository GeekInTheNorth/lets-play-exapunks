# 19 TEC EXA-Blaster Modem

In this mission, the hacker needs to copy overwrite the playlists of 8 radio stations, each can only be reached via dial up model, said modem can only connect to one radio station at a time.

Solution 02 improves on solution 01 by having EXA-A (XA) store the track names from file 300 before navigating to the modem where it dials the modem and replicates itself onto the radio stations. Logic for overwriting the playlists remains the same.

| Solution | Cycles | Size | Activity | EXA Modules|
|:---------|-------:|-----:|---------:|------------|
| 01       |    476 |   66 |       11 | [XA](01-XA.exa) [XB](01-XB.exa) |
| 02       |    240 |   66 |       11 | [XA](02-XA.exa) [XB](02-XB.exa) |
