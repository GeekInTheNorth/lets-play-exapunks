# 12 Workhouse

In this mission, the hacker is overwriting an expenses file so that the sum of all values is the same, but no value is more than $75 and the final value is less than or equal to $75.

Minor improvement in solution 2 after identifying that COPY X F overwrites the entry where the cursor is in a file, it does not insert the value.
